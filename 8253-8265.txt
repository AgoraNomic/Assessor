//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: ProposalNumber(raw=8253)
Title: Clarify salary
Adoption index: ProposalAI(raw=2.0)
Author: Murphy
Co-authors: G., Jason Cobb


Amend Rule 2559 (Paydays) by replacing this text:

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
     levied on em for eir conduct in that office during that time,
     that player earns 5 coins.

with this text:

  2. For each office, if a single player held that office for 16 or
     more days in the previous month and no unforgivable fines were
     levied on em during that month for eir conduct in that office,
     that player earns 5 coins.

[Legislates based on the judgement of CFJ 3774, but also covers edge
cases like "do something in late September, get dinged for it in early
October": you still earn your salary for September, but forfeit it for
October. Covering corner cases like "exit office in early October,
no October salary to forfeit, impose fine/debt against September salary"
is left as an exercise for future proposal authors.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: ProposalNumber(raw=8254)
Title: Anything is POSSIBLE
Adoption index: ProposalAI(raw=3.0)
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2152 ("Mother, May I?") by replacing the text "CAN:" with the
text "CAN, POSSIBLE:".

["POSSIBLE" is used in the Rules right now, but is never defined; this
defines it.]

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: ProposalNumber(raw=8255)
Title: Possibly-Indeterminate Switches
Adoption index: ProposalAI(raw=3.0)
Author: Jason Cobb
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2162 ("Switches") by replacing the paragraph beginning "If an
action or set of actions" with the following:

  If a type of switch is not explicitly designated as
  possibly-indeterminate by the rule that defines it, and if an action
  or set of actions would cause the value of an instance of that type
  of switch to become indeterminate, that instance instead takes on
  its last determinate and possible value, if any, otherwise it takes
  on its default value.

[Provides an escape hatch so that rules can allow their switches to have
indeterminate values. This has come up in protos by both me and
Falsifian. It is useful to have these possibly-indeterminate properties
be switches, since switches have useful properties and precedent, so the
always-determinate system cuts off some use-cases.]

Title: Elections Fix
