The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8202
Title: Police Power
Adoption index: 1.7
Author: Falsifian
Co-authors: Jason


In Rule 2557, replace the first paragraph with:

  When the rules authorize an investigator to impose the Cold Hand
  of Justice for a violation, e CAN do so by levying a fine of B on
  the perp by announcement, within the following guidelines:

and add a new list item at the start of the list (that is, right after
the first paragraph), with the text:

  - B is at least 1 and at most twice the base value of the
    violation.

Retitle Rule 2557 to "Sentencing Guidelines".

[Comment: Rule 2557 is currently titled "Removing Blots". When I tried
to understand why, I noticed that the 2018-04-07 SLR lists two Rule
2557s, one of which actually is about removing blots, and the other of
which is titled "Sentencing Guidelines". The next SLR I could find is
published much later, 2018-10-14, and has R2557 in or close to its
current form. I don't know exactly what happened there.]
