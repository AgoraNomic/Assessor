The replaced text differs from the one in the most\nrecent SLR because Falsifian cleaned the text by replacing \"them\" with\n\"em\" since then.]\n\nAmend Rule 2154 (\"Election Procedure\") by replacing the text \"In a\ntimely fashion after the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and SHALL\"\nwith the text \"After the nomination period ends, the ADoP CAN and, in a\ntimely fashion, SHALL\".\n\n[Ensures that the ADoP doesn't lose the ability to initiate an Agoran\nDecision for an election after a week passes.]"
