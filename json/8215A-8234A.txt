There\nare also honorable reasons to self-recuse (e.g. self-interest in the\ncase).  Changed this to the idea of \"if you're recused in any way after\nbeing assigned 4+ days, let us know why, before getting another case\",\nand only governed by a SHOULD.  It's as much about helping the Arbitor\nfigure out if the recused are still interested in judging.\n]"
