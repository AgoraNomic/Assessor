The full text of each ADOPTED proposal is included below:

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: 8322
Title: Unrepetition v1.1
Adoption index: 3.0
Author: Falsifian
Co-authors: Alexis, twg


For each of Proposals 8287-8307, if the proposal took effect more than
once, then any changes to rule text caused by the second and later
times the proposal took effect are considered "extra" for the purposes
of this proposal.

Reverse all such "extra" changes, in the reverse of the order in which
they occurred.

[Comment: See https://mailman.agoranomic.org/cgi-bin/mailman/private/agora-discussion/2020-February/056587.html
for context. I think the changes this undoes are relatively benign,
but it's nice to have certainty about the state of the ruleset.]
