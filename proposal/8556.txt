Title: Ministry Normalization
Adoption index: 1.0
Author: Jason

Amend Rule 2624 by inserting the following line after the line "Ministry
of Participation: 1 Voting Card": "Ministry of Legacy: 1 Victory Point"
and by deleting "and 1 Victory Point to every other player whose
Ministry Focus is Legacy".

[This allows the Concentration Stone to work (at least partially) for
players focused on Legacy.]
