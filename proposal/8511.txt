Current text:

{
  If a player has at least 20 more Victory Points than any other player, e
  CAN win by announcement. When a player wins this way, all Cards and
  all Products are destroyed. Then each non-zombie player is granted 1 card
  of each type.
}



This doesn't use an indirect method for winning, unlike most other rules.
This proposal changes that.

Amend Rule 2621 to read in whole:

{
  If a player has at least 20 more Victory Points than any other player, e CAN
  Take Over the Economy by announcement. When a player does so, e wins the
  game, all Cards and all Products are destroyed, then each non-zombie player
  is granted 1 card of each type.
}
