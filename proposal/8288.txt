Amend Rule 2602 (Glitter) to read:

  Each time a player earns a type of Ribbon while already owning
  that type of Ribbon, e CAN, once within the next 7 days, claim a
  consolation prize by announcement.  Claiming a consolation prize
  causes em to earn N+1 coins, where N is the number of players
  that do not own the same type of Ribbon.

[Tried to make it as clear as possible without being excessively
verbose.  I split it into two sentences because the change in timing
of the antecedent would otherwise create ambiguity about when "N+1"
should be evaluated.]
