Amend Rule 2481 by adding the following item to the sole list:
  "Non-Festive players CANNOT cause proposals to become Pended."

[This was here when I joined, then removed because we didn't have a concept
 of pending. I think this is a good restriction during festivals, so this
 proposal adds it back.]
