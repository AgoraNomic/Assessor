[This reduces proposal rewards by removing AI from the calculation.
As it is, an extremely detailed and well developed AI 1.0 proposal
that is adopted unanimously gets fewer coins than an AI 3.0 bug fix.

Note for the Assessor: Since this proposal is AI 1.0, its
reward is the same in both the old and the new systems. Please adjust
your algorithms for future proposals if this passes.]

Amend Rule 2496, "Rewards", by replacing:

  Being the author of an adopted proposal: a number of coins equal to
  ((the total number of valid ballots cast FOR the decision - the total
  number of valid ballots cast AGAINST) times the adoption index of the
  result) rounded up

with:

  Being the author of an adopted proposal: a number of coins equal to
  (the total number of valid ballots cast FOR the decision - the total
  number of valid ballots cast AGAINST)
