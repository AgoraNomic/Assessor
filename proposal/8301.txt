[The Rulekeepor is willing to take on this responsibility, and it
makes considerably more sense than making the officer include a random
section in their report; instead, it keeps all of the rules and regulations
together in one easily accessible place.]

Amend Rule 2493, Regulations, by changing the text

  "Regulations are tracked in their Promulgator's weekly report."
to read
  "Regulations are tracked by the Rulekeepor as part of eir
  weekly and monthly reports in a fashion similar to rules."
