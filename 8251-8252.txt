//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ID: ProposalNumber(raw=8251)
Title: Ruleset definition
Adoption index: ProposalAI(raw=3.0)
Author: G.
Co-authors: 


Amend Rule 2141 (Role and Attributes of Rules) by appending the following
text to its first paragraph:
  The ruleset is the set of all currently-existing rules.

[and while we're at it...]
Amend Rule 1030 (Precedence between Rules) by replacing all instances
of "Ruleset" with "ruleset".

[I mean, I think that definition matches what would be the "common"
definition anyway, but may be useful to have it there].

Title: Blasphemy
Adoption index: ProposalAI(raw=1.0)

Destroy the contract that is known as the Reformed Church of the Ritual.

[It's useless now.]
